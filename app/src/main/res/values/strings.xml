    <string name="neutral_pronation_answer">Feet stikefloor with heel first then roll towards the toes. Your arch lightly collapses inward. This is neutral pronation!</string>
    <string name="over_pronation_answer">Looks like the whole sole of your foot touches the ground. This means that you are an over pronator and the arch of your foot stretches inward too much.</string>
    <string name="under_pronation_answer">Outside of your foot has the most impact. This means that you are a under pronator. Your feet don\'t flex enough to provide proper shock absorption.</string>
